This is a single page React App allows you to keeping track of the films you have watched.
-
-You can add, edit and delete movie, also there is a search bar for finding specific movies.
- I have used local json-server for storing the data. If you want to use this version, you have to setup json server on your computer then making arragements according to related pathways or URL's.

- For the next step i'm planning to fetching data from real API
